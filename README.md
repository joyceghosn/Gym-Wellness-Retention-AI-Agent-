# Gym-Wellness-Retention-AI-Agent-
Gym Wellness & Retention AI Agent
Project Overview

This project builds a full Gym Wellness & Retention AI System that combines:

Synthetic behavioural data generation

A machine learning model (logistic regression) that predicts the probability of a “bad day tomorrow”

A Large Language Model (LLM) that generates personalized wellness explanations, 3-day micro-plans, and service recommendations

An automation workflow (n8n + Google Sheets + Twilio) that sends personalized SMS/WhatsApp retention messages

The goal is to:

Estimate member wellbeing risk using 7-day windows

Translate numerical risk into human-friendly coaching plans

Recommend one structured service offer from a fixed list

Automate retention messaging based on attendance, membership type, and birthdays

Provide gyms with a scalable AI blueprint for engagement, retention, and service promotion

Dataset
Data Sources

All datasets are located in the /data/ folder.

profiles.csv
Static member characteristics (age, sex, goal, baseline behaviour)

checkins.csv
Daily mood, stress, fatigue, sleep, activity, and label (bad_day_tomorrow)

AI Fitness dataset – Members.csv
n8n workflow input (attendance, preferred workout, tone…)

AI Fitness dataset – Logs.csv
Logged messages generated by n8n + OpenAI

daily_plans_output.csv
Example LLM-generated plans for a specific date

Key Concepts

Behaviour is simulated using realistic rules

7-day rolling windows capture weekly patterns

Target variable: bad_day_tomorrow (binary)

Feature Engineering

The model uses the following engineered features:

mood_avg_7d

stress_avg_7d

fatigue_avg_7d

sleep_avg_7d

activity_days_7d

sleep_debt_7d

These features summarize an entire week of wellbeing indicators and are highly predictive of next-day difficulty.

Machine Learning Model

A logistic regression model predicts:

P(bad_day_tomorrow = 1 | last 7 days)

Risk Mapping

LOW: score < 0.4 → performance strategy

MEDIUM: 0.4–0.7 → balanced strategy

HIGH: score ≥ 0.7 → recovery strategy

The ML output feeds directly into the LLM layer.

LLM Coaching System
1. Natural-Language Summary

Numerical features (e.g., sleep_avg_7d = 5.9) are converted to sentences like:

“sleep was short this week”

“fatigue is high”

“activity was low”

2. Risk Explanation

GPT generates an empathetic explanation of why tomorrow may be difficult or easy.

3. Personalized 3-Day Micro-Plan

Includes:

sleep targets

specific activity recommendations

stress management techniques

4. Structured Offer Recommendation

Chosen from a fixed list:

yoga class

mobility class

pilates session

personal training session

nutrition consultation

stress-coaching session

This allows Power BI to track service popularity across risk segments.

Automation Workflow (n8n)

Below is the operational workflow for retention messaging:

The automation handles:

New member welcome sequences

Low attendance follow-up

High attendance encouragement

Birthday messages with offers

Messages are generated using OpenAI inside n8n, logged to Google Sheets, and sent through Twilio.

Power BI Dashboard

The dashboard provides insights into:

Offer distribution (which services the AI recommends most)

Risk level segmentation (LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH)

Attendance classifications (new, low, high, birthdays)

Message logs and trends

Architecture

The system integrates:

Colab (ML + LLM pipeline)

Google Sheets (data exchange layer)

n8n (business logic & automation)

Twilio (SMS sending)

Power BI (analytics & offer tracking)

LLM and ML components feed into n8n to create a closed-loop retention system.

Future Work

Integrate with real gym CRM data

Replace logistic regression with survival models or tree-based models

Add coach-in-the-loop approval interface

Use event-driven architecture for real-time messaging

Track member response to plans for reinforcement learning improvements

Conclusion

This project demonstrates a complete AI-driven retention ecosystem that merges synthetic data, machine learning, LLM coaching, workflow automation, and BI analytics into one unified solution. It is a practical and production-ready blueprint for real gyms aiming to improve retention, wellbeing, and service adoption.
